      tags$blockquote(h3("Abstract"),"Assessing levels of standing genetic variation within species requires a robust sampling
for the purpose of accurate specimen identification using molecular techniques such
as DNA barcoding; however, statistical estimators for what constitutes a robust sample
are currently lacking. Moreover, such estimates are needed because most species are
currently represented by only one or a few sequences in existing databases, which
can safely be assumed to be undersampled. Unfortunately, sample sizes of 5â€“10
specimens per species typically seen in DNA barcoding studies are often insufficient to
adequately capture within-species genetic diversity. Here, we introduce a novel iterative
extrapolation simulation algorithm of haplotype accumulation curves, called HACSim
(Haplotype Accumulation Curve Simulator) that can be employed to calculate likely
sample sizes needed to observe the full range of DNA barcode haplotype variation that
exists for a species. Using uniform haplotype and non-uniform haplotype frequency
distributions, the notion of sampling sufficiency (the sample size at which sampling
accuracy is maximized and above which no new sampling information is likely to be
gained) can be gleaned. HACSim can be employed in two primary ways to estimate
specimen sample sizes: (1) to simulate haplotype sampling in hypothetical species,
and (2) to simulate haplotype sampling in real species mined from public reference
sequence databases like the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) or GenBank for any
genomic marker of interest. While our algorithm is globally convergent, runtime is
heavily dependent on initial sample sizes and skewness of the corresponding haplotype
frequency distribution.",style="font-size:1vw; color:white;position:fixed;left:2%;bottom:2%;")
